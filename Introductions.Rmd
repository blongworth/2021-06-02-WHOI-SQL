# Getting help and giving feedback

We are here to help! Raise your hand and a helper or instructor will message you in the chat. If it can't be solved via chat you and the helper will move to a breakout room to talk through the problem.

We'll also ask for input and feedback often. Use "yes" and "no" in the participants window. Coffee break indicator also welcome, but we've got a lot to cover!
