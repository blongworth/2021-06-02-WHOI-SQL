  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  for data management with relational databases and SQL.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
